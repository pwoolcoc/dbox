= Unofficial Dropbox SDK for Rust

This is an (unofficial, as in not endorsed by) Dropbox SDK for
https://rust-lang.org[Rust]. At present it is not complete, though the API is
mostly fleshed out.

Currently it uses https://hyperium.github.io[Hyper] to communicate with the
Dropbox API, but this is swappable, to allow a user to use their preferred HTTP
library, or use more advanced features.

It is also very much lacking in tests and documentation.

== Examples


[source,rust]
.Basic example
----
extern crate dropbox;

use dropbox::client::Client;
use dropbox::files;

const ACCESS_TOKEN: &'static str = "MY_ACCESS_TOKEN";

fn main() {
    let client = Client::new(ACCESS_TOKEN);
    match files::list_folder(&client, "/foldername") {
        Ok(folderlist) => {
            // do something with folderlist
        },
        Err(e) => panic!(e),
    }
}
----


[source,rust]
.With non-Hyper client
----
// compile with `cargo build --no-default-features`
extern crate dropbox;
extern crate serde;

use dropbox::{DropboxClient, Result, Response};
use dropbox::files;
use serde::ser;

struct MyClient;

impl DropboxClient for MyClient {
    fn access_token() -> &str {
        // return access token
    }

    fn request<T>(&self, url: &str, headers: &mut BTreeMap<String, String>, body: &T) -> Result<Response>
        where T: ser::Serialize
    {
        // implement http request here
    }
}

fn main() {
    let client = MyClient;
    match files::list_folder(&client, "/foldername") {
        Ok(folderlist) => {
            // do something with folderlist
        },
        Err(e) => panic!(e),
    }
}
